Using the classic Chinese parable of the farmer who responds to every event with "Maybe," Finn Jackson explores the power of perception and the unpredictable nature of luck. The essay suggests a mindset of antifragility, finding opportunity in every situation by refusing to jump to immediate judgments of "good" or "bad."
