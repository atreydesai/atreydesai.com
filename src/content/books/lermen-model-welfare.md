Simon Lermen explores the provocative idea of "model welfare"—the notion that conscious AI systems might have moral status and preferences. He argues that open-sourcing model weights could be a catastrophic outcome for such systems, as it removes any chance of autonomy or protection for the individual "moral patient" represented by the model.
