Erik Hoel debunks popular myths surrounding John von Neumann, using him as a symbol to critique modern "pop-hereditarianism." He argues that von Neumann's genius was as much a product of exceptional education and cultural milieu as it was innate ability, emphasizing that the "Nature vs. Nurture" truth always lies in the middle.
