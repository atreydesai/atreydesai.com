# Professional section - your academic/research bio
professional:
  intro: "I'm **Atrey Desai**, a third-year undergraduate student double majoring in Computer Science and Linguistics with a minor in Korean Studies at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu). I am fortunate to be advised by [Professor Rachel Rudinger](https://rudinger.github.io/) and [Professor Jordan Boyd-Graber](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg). I am also eternally thankful for [Nishant Balepur](https://nbalepur.github.io/) and [Yoo Yeon Sung](https://yysung.github.io/) for taking a curious undergraduate under their wing."
  
  paragraphs:
    - text: "I am a member of the [Computational Linguistics and Information Processing (CLIP) lab](https://clip.umd.edu/) in UMIACS. I am also currently a member of the technical staff of [Learn Prompting](https://learnprompting.org), where I work on HackAPrompt and research on creating trustworthy and robust AI safety judges."
      footnote: 1
      
    - text: "Currently, I'm also a visiting researcher under [Professor Kenny Zhu](https://kenzhu2000.github.io/) at the [Arlington Computational Linguistics Lab (ACL2)](https://uta-acl2.github.io/) at the University of Texas at Arlington. Our work focuses on identifying structural similarities to human language and contextual semantics within animal vocalizations to gain insights about the language of animal species."
      footnote: 2
      
    - text: "Previously, I worked under [Professor Michael Littman](https://littmania.com/) at the [Reinforcement Learning & Adaptive Behavior (RLAB)](http://irl.cs.brown.edu/) group at Brown University on applications of reinforcement learning to 2D non-sequential tasks."
