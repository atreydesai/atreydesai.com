tldr: "We introduce a multilingual benchmark to evaluate how Large Language Models (LLMs) understand multi-turn humor in English and Spanish through joke classification and line-purpose identification tasks. We find that while larger open-source models (32B) significantly outperform smaller ones, all models struggle with nuanced humor comprehension and are highly sensitive to adversarial perturbations and cross-cultural linguistic differences."
