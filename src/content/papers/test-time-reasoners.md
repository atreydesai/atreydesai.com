tldr: While choices-only success is often deemed problematic, reasoning traces reveal that LLMs use less problematic strategies like inferring missing questions, challenging claims that partial-input success is always a flaw. Consequently, reasoning traces could help separate problematic data from less problematic reasoning.

imageDescription: "LLM accuracy with/without reasoning in full/choices-only MCQA settings. * are significant differences (paired t-test p < 0.05, 0.001, 0.0001). TTR boosts Full accuracy in most cases, and for Choices-Only in 15/36 cases."
